# Feel the MERN ðŸ”¥

MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js

## Getting Started

### What to expect

* Build a simple CRUD todo application using the MERN stack

### Let's begin! ... Where do I start?

For the purposes of this exercise, you will be using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), as it is currently the recommended method on the official documentation. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#user-content-1) However, please take the time to briefly understand what this setup is providing your application behind the scenes. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#user-content-2)

You will name your application `mern-todo`, or another name of your choice, when you first run `create-react-app`.

```shell
create-react-app mern-todo && cd mern-todo/
```

### The Four Stages of MERN

This exercise will broken into four stages, to ease into the application building process.

* [Stage 1: *Frontend*](#stage-1-frontend)
* Stage 2: *Backend*
* Stage 3: *Database*
* Stage 4: *CRUD*
